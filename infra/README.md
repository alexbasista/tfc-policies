# Policy Sets - Infrastructure

This directory contains a Terraform configuration that leverages the `tfe` provider to create, connect, and manage your Sentinel and/or OPA policy set(s) via the API instead of leveraging VCS integration.

If you are using the VCS integration to connect and manage your policy set(s), then this directory is not relevant and should be ignored.
